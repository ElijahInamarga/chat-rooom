# chat-room

An exploration of low-level networking concepts, this C-based chat application provides a scalable alternative for real-time, 
multi-client messaging without the overhead of high-level frameworks through the implemention of a custom TCP server-client architecture.

## How to use
The architecture follows a centralized server-client model, where a dedicated hub manages concurrent connections and facilitates real-time
communication between all connected peers.

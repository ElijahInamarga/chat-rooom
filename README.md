# chat-room

A C-based chat application for real-time, multi-client messaging without the overhead of high-level frameworks through the implemention of a custom TCP server-client architecture. 

## How to use
This architecture follows a centralized server-client model, where a dedicated hub manages concurrent connections and manages real-time
communication between all connected users.
